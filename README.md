# learning_based_img_compression

The `pytorch_compression-results.ipynb` notebook reproduces our results with the saved model for the 3 different compression quality. The wandb report so the same is located [here](https://wandb.ai/umass-iesl-is/696ds-learning-based-image-compression/reports/Baseline-Results--Vmlldzo0MDMyNTM3) 

The experiments are located under `baseline`, run the `run.sh <compression_quality>` to launch an SBATCH job, compression quality is a setting in `[1, 4, 8]`
