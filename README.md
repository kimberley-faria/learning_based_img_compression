# learning_based_img_compression

The `pytorch_compression-results.ipynb` notebook reproduces our results with the saved model for the 3 different compression quality.

The experiments are located under `baseline`, run the `run.sh <compression_quality>` to launch an SBATCH job, compression quality is a setting in `[1, 4, 8]`
